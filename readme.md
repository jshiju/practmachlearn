This is the github repo for the 'Practical Machine Learning' course project.

**Project Title:**
Predicting activity(exercise) quality from activity monitors using machine learning algorithm

**Synopsis:**
The purpose of this project is to develop and build a model using machine learning techniques, based on the WLE(Weight Lifting Exercise) Dataset, to predict the manner in which an health participant performed an exercise on 20 different test cases with 'classe' as the ressponse variable.

**Background:**
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

**Report:**
The markdown document for the report is - "prediction_report.Rmd" and the HTML version is "prediction_report.html". A PDF version is also provided for easy reading. Please note that the number of pages in PDF report is more than 5 becuase the figures are scaled to fit for clarity.
